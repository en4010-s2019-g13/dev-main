        <p class="lead">I'm Olusola Fatade, though I go by Sola (pronounced "show-la"). I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University and recently joined the National Society of Black Engineers' (NSBE) Florida Chapter. I also hold strong interests in business and education. My hobbies include sports (soccer, basketball, table tennis, etc), coaching, reading, dancing, videography, and volunteering.</p>

            <h3>Awesome Opportunities I've Been A Part Of:</h3>
            <ul>

                    I attended FAU High School, which allowed me to start attending college at the age of 14. The program prepares 9th graders to handle college courseloads, and then pays for them to take classes at the university from 10th-12th grade. I graduated in May of 2019 as a nationally recognized National Merit Semifinalist, with 102 credits earned towards a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science and a certification from the Max Planck Florida Institute. <p><a href="http://www.fauhigh.fau.edu/">Visit the FAUHS website.</a></p></li>

                    Being a National Merit Semifinalist, I was offered the opportunity to be one of the first six high school students to study at the Max Planck Institute for Neuroscience in Jupiter, Florida. We were trained to create neural networks capable of processing the immense amount of data gathered by the researchers at the institute. My team worked on creating a network capable of identifying vesicles in the images provided by the scientists. Our tenure as the inagural class was successful and the FAU Max Planck academy is now set to open in Fall 2020 (as a part of the new partnership between FAU and Max Planck).<p><a href="https://maxplanckacademy.fau.edu/">Visit the Max Planck Academy website.</a></p></li><br>

                    The Machine Perception and Cognition Robotics (MPCR) Lab at FAU contacted me to join them as they formed a partnership with the gym TrainerSpace, looking to implement their Machine Learning based pose-tracking software in TrainerSpace's facilities. We've received funding from the NSF and are currently working towards commercializing the technology.<p><a href="https://www.mpcrlab.com/">Visit the MPCR Lab website. </a>/<a href="https://www.trainerspace.com/?v=7516fd43adaa">     Visit the Trainerspace website</a></p></li>

                    From 4th to 6th grade I participated in a dance program called Minds In Motion (MiM), founded by the Richmond Ballet. An in-school program, it also offers a more select after-school program for those who are more inclined. I was able to join the after-school program and traveled with the dance troupe throughout the state, performing different choreographies.<p><a href="https://www.richmondballet.com/mim/about/">Visit the MiM website website.</a></p></li>

            <i>Upon recieving my Bachelors in CE, I plan to continue my education by applying to a select number of universities to earn my Masters in Business Administration. In the meantime, aside from my studies, I love to engage in small projects to enhance my proficency in areas I hope will be applicable to my future. For example, I recently programmed a game, shown below:</i>
